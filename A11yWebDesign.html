<p>We did not forget about our website design services. With our shift to Web Accessibile we could not bring ourself to use a basic CMS Platforms anymore. This is due to the fact that most
CMS platforms were develped before web accessibility became a thing. That's is not to say they are not working on accessibility, but in reality this funtionality could require a complete redesign of the
CMS and that takes time.</p>

<p>Currently we are offer our A11y Website - Managed service. This services uses a Static Site Generator (SSG) requires our team to manage all site updates.</p>

<p>Our development team is working on integrating a CMS platform that is built from the ground up with web accessiility in mind. Once this is in place we will be able to offer a Self-Managed
option that will give  your team access to a CMS Platform to manage the day-to-day site updates.</p>

<p>The cost of the A11y Website - Managed service will be based on a range of pages.</p>
