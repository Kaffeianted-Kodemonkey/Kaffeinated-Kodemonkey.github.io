    <h2>Get found. Generate traffic. Grow revenue.</h2>

    <p>In the ever-growing online community, it is more important than ever to make sure your business is found in a search. You could let the search engine spiders
    find and index your site on their own, however, this can take time... lots and lots of time for there are millions of pages on the internet that they are
    crawling every day. Then once you are indexed you may not stay indexed. Why? Because websites grow old and business close they dump their database now and
    again for a fresh clean list.</p>

    <p>Why risk the chance of getting listed only to be removed and start all over again. Plus you have no idea when this is happening or how it is affecting your
    overall listing. The simplest and most cost-effective way is through local listings. We will submit your site or over 300 website directories and listing database.</p>

    <h2>How does this work?</h2>

    <p>I years past one would send their site information to the search engine or directory and take them to add them to the list. Over time they have gotten more
    sophisticated. Although you can submit your information to the search engines it is more challenging to find the free form if they still have one at all. Most want
    you to pay $100 plus to be listed and that will not guarantee you do not get wiped with the next database dump.</p>

    <p>Today we have data aggregators. These are the top four (4) companies that manage a database of website listing for the search engines to pull listings form.
    If your site is listed with the aggregators you can rest assured that when the search engines do a database dump they will relist your site once they pull the
    listings form the aggregators.</p>

            A strong online presence is the first step toward success. Your customers and prospects need to be able to find you, both online and in the street. Ask yourself this, when was the last time you went out to eat at a new restaurant or planned to go see a new movie and did not look it up online first? Chances are, you did some research beforehand and it's extremely likely that your customers are doing the same. When customers and prospects look you up online, make sure they can find you and that the information they come across is correct.

            For SEO, priority is given to good customer experience on mobile devices. Consumers will use mobile devices to find desired goods or services and will generally
            begin these searches with a category or brand search. For example, a brand search is “Joe’s Pizza in Denver” and a category search is “Pizza in Denver”. (Note:
            On a mobile device the “in Denver” often does not need to be explicit.) In the case of a category search, the user has the intent to purchase something in a
            category but has not decided or does not care about the brand. In these searches, the user’s intent is generally heavily skewed toward proximity and location.
            So search engines generally deliver the closest locations and it is therefore important that location information is crawlable, is displayed on
            each page, and is in meta-data and keywords.
