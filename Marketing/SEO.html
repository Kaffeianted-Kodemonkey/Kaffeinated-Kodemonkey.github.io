      <p>SEO makes it possible for businesses like yours to compete online by moving your websites higher in local search rankings.</p>

      <h2>What is SEO?</h2>

      <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to your website through organic
      search engine results. This is achieved by using on-page and off-page factors to help you in reaching the goal of being number one in a search for your
      services or products.</p>

      <p>SEO focuses on improving the rankings in the organic – aka non-paid – search results. If you have a website and you want to get more traffic, SEO should
      be part of your marketing efforts.</p>

      <h2>DIYers</h2>

      <p>I know that there are a few of you out there are thinking, "I can do this", Kudos for you and I want to help you as you embark on this large task. First, off
      it takes time, whether you go at it alone or have us help you, SEO is not an instant gratification type of thing. It needs time some can take three (3) months
      to show any ROI others can take up to six (6) months. So be patient and diligent set aside some time each week to work SEO.</p>

      <ul  class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fa-li" ><i class="far fa-check-circle"></i></span><strong>Select quality keywords over quantity:</strong> Rather than optimizing for dozens or
        even hundreds of keywords, we take a “less is more” approach to keyword selection. We conduct exhaustive research and vetting to find the ideal list of keywords
        that will perform best for each client.</li>
        <li><span class="fa-li" ><i class="far fa-check-circle"></i></span><strong>Become relevant for those keywords:</strong> We match your website code and content
        to your chosen keywords. We also create high-quality content across the Web. This helps Google and your customers know that your business is a relevant result to those keyword searches.</li>
        <li><span class="fa-li" ><i class="far fa-check-circle"></i></span><strong>Earn trust and authority for those keywords:</strong> We act as an online marketing extension of your business, promoting your
        business everywhere your customers are searching. We’ll also create content that will help develop a diverse and natural link portfolio, earning you the trust of Google and your customers.</li>
        <li><span class="fa-li" ><i class="far fa-check-circle"></i></span><strong>Monitor progress and adjust as needed:</strong> Your SEO team will keep a regular watch on your keyword rankings. When
        needed, they will step in and adjust your strategy and tactics to keep your campaign on the right course.</li>
        <li><span class="fa-li" ><i class="far fa-check-circle"></i></span><strong>Maintain page one rankings:</strong> Once you achieve first page rankings, we help you maintain them by continuing to
        build trust and relevance for your website through ongoing content creation and link portfolio development. This will help keep you ahead of your competitors and successfully adapt to ever-changing algorithm updates.</li>
        <li><span class="fa-li" ><i class="far fa-check-circle"></i></span><strong>Build again with new keywords:</strong> Now that you’ve got the attention of Google and your online presence is growing, the best thing you can
        do is leverage this momentum and optimize for new keywords. We do this by repeating steps one through five.</li>

              Search engines like Google look at two things when evaluating your website and deciding where to rank it - RELEVANCE and TRUST. RELEVANCE is the content of a website and the code behind the scenes. If your code is optimized and the content on your site is relevant to a search, Google will move you up in the rankings. TRUST refers to how many other sites on the internet are linking back to your site. If a large number of high-quality sites are pointing to you, Google will start to trust you and move you up in the rankings.
