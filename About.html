<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey is a specialized web accessibility agency dedicated to making the digital world accessible for everyone. Founded by a
seasoned web developer with a strong background in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails</strong>, Kaffeinated Kodemonkey brings technical
expertise and a commitment to creating ADA-compliant websites that prioritize accessibility.</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>
<p>The journey began in 2015 when our founder encountered a web accessibility document while working on a project with a college. This document,
intended to outline the college’s commitment to accessibility, was over three years old and had never been implemented. Although the college
considered the document sufficient despite its outdated state, this response sparked our founder’s interest and concern about web accessibility.
Driven to go beyond “good enough,” our founder attempted to implement accessibility changes but received significant pushback. This experience
ultimately motivated them to expand from freelance development into establishing an agency focused on accessibility and ADA compliance.</p>

<p>Today, Kaffeinated Kodemonkey is a trusted partner in web accessibility, providing in-depth site evaluations for ADA compliance and developing
accessible web solutions across diverse industries.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Our mission is simple yet powerful—to ensure the web is a barrier-free space where all users, regardless of ability, can fully engage. Our
hands-on mentorship program also supports this mission by nurturing the next generation of <strong>A11y Developers</strong> and <strong>Subject
Matter Experts (SMEs)</strong>, equipping emerging talents with skills, experience, and the dedication to become future leaders in digital
accessibility.</p>
