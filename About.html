<p class="text-center"><strong>Coming from a background of learning disabilities; and a family with colorblindness, accessibility is never far from home.</strong></p>

<p>In her early twenties, she built a website for her father to give him a platform to communicate and share stories and photos with other vets.
She knew her father was colorblind but did not realize how much it impacted his ability to read digital content.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>"No one will use it. We are having a hard time seeing the pages."</strong></p>

<p>Over the years, as her skills grew and she learned about web accessibility, she was brought back to her first website. She now had a solution, although a bit late,
she decied to turned her focus to making digital content accessible.</p>

<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey originated in 2015 as a web design agency. As our focus shifted, we started implementing Web Accessibility into our business model and services.
Kaffeinated Kodemonkey is now an accessibility development agency. Building websites with an accessibility-first approach, along with accessibility evaluations, certifications,
and monitoring.</p>

<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey also realized that web accessibility is more than just assisting users with disabilities to interact with digital products. Web Accessibility also enhances
the ability of search engines to understand and list your product more accurately through natural SEO allowing more visitors with disabilities to see and interact with your product.</p>
