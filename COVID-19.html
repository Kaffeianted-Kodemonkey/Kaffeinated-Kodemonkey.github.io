    <h2>How we are helping</h2>
    <p>In light of COVID-19, many businesses are turning to remote/work-from-home alternatives to comply with
    the CDC guidelines. During this time may companies will be finding out how ADA compliant or resilient their
    websites and platforms truly are. </p>

    <p>At kaffeinated Kodemonkey we are doing our share to keep our clients up and running and to offer
    assistance where we can to all local and governmental.</p>

    <p>We are offering discounts on our Services with deferred payments for those that qualify. <a href="https://kaffeinatedkodemonkey.youcanbook.me/">Book a consultation</a> and
    let's chat about how we can help you keep your business running from the safety of your home.</p>

    <h2>Stay Informed and updated</h2>
    <p>Now is a great time to stop to smell the roses and reflect on how blesed we are to be here today.</p>
    <p>There are many websites to keep you updated on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> so I am going
    to defer that to the experts.</p>

    <p>However at kaffeinated Kodemonkey we find that this is a great time to grab a cup of coffee or tea,
    relax in your comfy pants and dive into what Web Accessibility means to you and your business.</p>

    <p>We have started a series of post that brake down the four WCAG principles that are the base of our
    accessibility drive development and how you can implement them into your website for a more accessible
    experience for your users.</p>

    <p>The first post is <a href="{{site-url}}/blog/accessibility/POUR-Web-Design">"POUR Web Design"</a> and explains how we build our sites
    to be accessible from the get to. You can also check out all post in the series at <a href="{{site.url}}/blof/Accessibility">Accessibility</a>.
    We are adding a new post each week and if you join our newsletter we will notify you when the next one in the sires
    is available.</p>
