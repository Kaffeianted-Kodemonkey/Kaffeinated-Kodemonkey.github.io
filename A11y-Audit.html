<p>A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) is a valuable self-disclosing document that outlines how a product aligns with each aspect of the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) criteria and provides insights into its level of accessibility and compliance status. Utilizing the VPAT allows you to assess your website's
current compliance with WCAG requirements.</p>

<p>WCAG serves as the benchmark for criteria requirements in the VPAT document. It is crucial for all federal and local government websites to meet the WCAG conformance
level of AA. Similarly, in the UK, compliance with the European Accessibility standards EN 301 is necessary.</p>

<p>Sometimes a VPAT is are requested as part of an RFP or Cotract.</p>

<h2>Simplifing the process</h2>
<p>VPATs are complex and confusing, and individuals designated to handle them may lack familiarity with web accessibility services, WCAG requirements, and ADA compliance.
Attempting to complete the VPAT in-house can be challenging and often leads to oversight or misinterpretation of WCAG and Section 508 requirements.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended to work with a third-party provider offering accessibility services. When selecting such a provider, consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li class="mt-1"><strong>Testing Method:</strong> Automated testing alone will not caught all issues, including manuel testing validates automated testising and reviles
   issues not picked up.</li>
  <li class="mt-1"><strong>Check Credentials:</strong> Certifications and Memberships help detriment level of understanding ada compliant components such as VPAT, WCAG, 508, and EU 301.</li>
  <li class="mt-1"><strong>Check the Portfolio:</strong> Examine the accessibility of their clients' sites using free accessibility tools. Identify any potential issues and ensure the site was recently evaluated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SEO Boost</h2>

<p>Accessibility not only helps improve ROI
through on-page SEO by making your content discoverable and understandable by users and search engine bots but also enhances the overall user experience, making it perceivable,
operable, understandable, and robust. This, in turn, increases your site's organic traffic.</p>

<p>Moreover, web accessibility and SEO go hand in hand. By adhering to the W3C's POUR principles, which focus on Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust design,
you position your website for success in both accessibility and SEO. An accessibility-first approach naturally fosters excellent SEO practices, as it provides search engines
with additional information about your site and pages, enabling them to display search results that accurately match user queries.</p>

<p>If you are seeking support from shareholders or require additional marketing budgets, emphasizing accessibility can be advantageous. A VPAT can effectively demonstrate the
accessibility status and highlight any existing issues, facilitating conversations with management or shareholders about the importance of becoming ADA compliant. For government
entities, compliance with Section 508 is a mandatory requirement.</p>
