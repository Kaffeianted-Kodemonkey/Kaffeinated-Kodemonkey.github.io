<p>A <strong>Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)</strong> is a valuable self-disclosing document that outlines how a product aligns with each aspect of the
<strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</strong> criteria and provides insights into its level of accessibility status throug a Web Accessibility
Audit and Evaluation with a completed VPAT Certification. Utilizing the <strong>VPAT</strong> allows you to assess your website's current Web Accessibility status.</p>

<p><strong>WCAG</strong> serves as the benchmark for criteria requirements ensuring that your website meets the necessary standards. All federal and local government
websites need to meet the WCAG conformance level of AA. Similarly, the European Accessibility standards <strong>EN 301</strong> is necessary for the UK. Sometimes, a
VPAT Certification is requested as part of an RFP or contract.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the process</h2>

<p>Simplifying the process of a Web Accessibility Audit and Evaluation and <strong>VPAT</strong> completion is crucial, as these tasks can be complex and confusing. Individuals
designated to handle them may lack familiarity with conducting a web accessibility audit, guidelines, services, WCAG requirements, and ADA compliance. Attempting to complete the
VPAT in-house can be challenging and often leads to oversight or misinterpretation of WCAG and Section 508 requirements.</p>

<p>To streamline the process, we highly recommend working with a third-party provider offering accessibility services. When selecting such a provider, consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li class="mt-1"><strong>Testing Method:</strong> Automated testing alone will not catch all issues, including manual testing validates automated testing and reviles issues not picked up.</li>
  <li class="mt-1"><strong>Check Credentials:</strong> Certifications and Memberships help detriment level of understanding ada compliant components such as VPAT, WCAG, 508, and EU 301.</li>
  <li class="mt-1"><strong>Check the Portfolio:</strong> Examine the accessibility of client's sites using free accessibility tools. Identify any potential issues and ensure the site was recently evaluated.</li>
</ul>
