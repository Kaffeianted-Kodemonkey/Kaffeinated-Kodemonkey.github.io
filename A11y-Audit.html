    <p>A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) is a self-disclosing document that details how a product aligns with the WCAG
    criteria. It provides insights into the product’s level of accessibility through a comprehensive Web Accessibility Audit and
    Evaluation. Completing a VPAT allows you to assess and document your website's current accessibility status.</p>

    <p>A VPAT is a great way to demonstrate your site's current compliance level and can be instrumental in gaining buy-in for a full
    compliance audit. It effectively highlights any existing issues and facilitates conversations with management or shareholders about
    the importance of becoming ADA Compliant. For government entities, compliance with Section 508 is mandatory, making Accessibility
    Evaluation and VPAT documentation essential.</p>

    <p><strong>Notably:</strong> VPATs are often required in Requests for Proposals (RFPs) to ensure that products meet specific
    accessibility standards.</p>
