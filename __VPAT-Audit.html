  <h2>What is a VPAT Audit</h2>
  <p>A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) Audit is your key to proving ADA compliance for contracts and procurement.
  Our process assesses your website against WCAG 2.2 and Section 508 guidelines, delivering a detailed report that highlights
  accessibility strengths and gaps. Whether you’re bidding on a government project or ensuring regulatory alignment, our VPAT
  Audit sets the stage for actionable improvements.</p>
