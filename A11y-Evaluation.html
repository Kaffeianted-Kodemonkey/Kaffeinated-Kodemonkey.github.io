<p>A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template is a document that evaluates how accessible a particular product is according ada compliance standards.
It is a self-disclosing document that details each aspect of the WCAG requirements and how the product is supported.</p>

<p>This documents use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for criteria requirements. All federal and local government websites must meet WCAG
conformances level of AA. In the UK, you will need to follow the European Accessibility standards EN 301.</p>

<p>When a company attempts to complete the VPAT in-house, they tend to miss issues or misinterpret the WCAG and Section 508 requirements. VPATs are complex
and confusing, most times those designated to handle them have not even heard of web accessibility let alone the WCAG requirements and ADA Compliace. </p>

<p>Completing the VPAT can be frustrating unless you have an accessibility developer on hand. When looking for a third party to assist your team with
accessibility requirements, consider these things before hiring:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure they do manual testing and not just automated testing; as there is a lot that can be missing through automation alone.</li>
  <li>Check credentials - What memberships do they hold, and what certifications do they have?</li>
</ul>

evaluate the status of digital content.</p>

exp: len: en, this lets assistive technology know what language to use. Overall accessibility adds additional information to the digital content that assists the web spiders and
search engines in listing and returning valuable search results.</p>

<p>If your team is looking for buy-in by shareholders or your marketing budgets in looking spar.. accessibility can help.</p>

<p>A VPAT can demonstrate accessibility status and issues, helping you start a conversation with management or shareholders about becoming ADA-compliant. If you are a government entity,
