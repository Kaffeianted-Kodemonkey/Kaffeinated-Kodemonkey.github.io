<p>A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) is a self-disclosing document that details each aspect of the WCAG criteria and how the product is
supported. Overall the VPAT template will demestrats the accessibility level and ada compliance status.</p>

<p>The VPAT document uses the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for criteria requirements. All federal and local government websites must meet WCAG
conformances level of AA. In the UK, you will need to follow the European Accessibility standards EN 301.</p>

<p>When a company attempts to complete the VPAT template in-house, they tend to miss issues or misinterpret the WCAG and Section 508 requirements. VPATs are complex and confusing,
most times those designated to handle them have not even heard of web ,accessibility services let alone the WCAG requirements and ADA Compliace.</p>

<p>Completing the VPAT can be frustrating unless you have an accessibility developer on hand. When veting a third party with accessigiltiy services consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Verify Manual testing:</strong> Do they condust manual testing or are they running automated testing only; as there is a lot that can be missing through automation alone.</li>
  <li><strong>Verify credentials:</strong> Are they ada compliant and hold an VPAT template or Accessibility Compliance Report? What certifications do they have?</li>
  <li><strong>Memberships:</strong> What memberships are they are of?</li>
  <li><strong>Demonstrate a strong understanding of ada compliant compnents:</strong> WCAG and Section 508, maybe EU 301.</li>
  <li><strong>Check portfolio:</strong> Use some free accessibility tool on their clients sites. How do they standup? Are there any issues? When was the site last evaluated?</li>
</ul>
