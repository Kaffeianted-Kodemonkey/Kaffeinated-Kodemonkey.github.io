<p>A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) is a document that evaluates how accessible a particular product is according to the WCAG & Section 508 Standards.
It is a self-disclosing document that details each aspect of the WCAG & Section 508 requirements and how the product supports the criteria. The VPAT documents use the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for criteria requirements. All sections of a website must meet the conformances level of AA. In the UK, you will need to
follow the European Accessibility standards EN 301.</p>

<p>VVPATs are complex and confusing. The people who receive the VPAT most times donâ€™t understand how to interpret the document or the WCAG requirements. When a company
attempts to complete the VPAT in-house, they tend to miss issues or misinterpret the WCAG and Section 508 requirements.</p>

<p>
Completing the VPAT can get frustrating unless you have an accessibility developer on hand. When looking for a third party to assist your team with accessibility requirements,
consider these things before hiring:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure they do manual testing and not just automated testing. The is a lot that can be missing through automation alone.</li>
  <li>Check credentials - What memberships do they hold, and what certifications do they have?</li>
</ul>

<p>A VPAT can demonstrate accessibility status and issues, helping you start a conversation with management or shareholders about becoming ADA-compliant. If you are a government entity,
being Section 508 compliant is becoming more of a requirement.</p>
