<h2><u>ADA Compliance</u></h2>

<p>ADA compliance is the legal responsibility of certain businesses to be accessible to the disabled, by complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”).</p>

<p>Originally this referred to brick-and-mortar stores meaning they had to create physical accessibility, for example, installing accessible parking spaces and building ramps.
However, with more and more content becoming digital, many courts have agreed that the law requires accessibility on websites so that commercial websites can be used by blind and
visually impaired people and others with applicable disabilities.</p>
