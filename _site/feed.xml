Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

    <h2>Your Guide to Inclusive Web Design</h2>
    <p>Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of their abilities, can navigate the web effortlessly. This vision drives the Web
    Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These guidelines are more than just rules—they’re
    the foundation for creating web content that’s accessible to all, including people with disabilities.</p>

    <h3>The Foundation of Web Accessibility: <strong><em>POUR</em></strong> Design</h3>
    <p>In 2008, WCAG 2.0 introduced the POUR principles, a framework that every developer and accessibility expert should know by
    heart:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Perceivable:</strong> Information should be presented in ways that everyone can perceive.
      Think text alternatives for non-text content, or captions for videos—everyone deserves to access content, regardless of their
      sensory abilities.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Operable:</strong> Make sure that all users can operate your site. This means every
      functionality should be available from a keyboard, with enough time to read and interact with the content.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Understandable:</strong> Your website’s information and operation should be easy to
      understand. This includes readable text, predictable page layouts, and user-friendly error handling.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Robust:</strong> Content needs to be robust enough to work reliably with various
      technologies, including assistive tools. No user should be left out because their tech isn't compatible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Mastering these principles isn’t just about compliance; it’s about making your site more user-friendly and inclusive.</p>

    <h3>The Evolution of WCAG: Keeping Up with Progress</h3>
    <p>Web accessibility isn’t static. As technology and our understanding of user needs evolve, so do the WCAG standards:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">WCAG 2.0 (2008)</strong> Laid the groundwork with the <strong><em>POUR</em></strong> principles listed above.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">WCAG 2.1 (2018)</strong> Expanded the guidelines, focusing on mobile users and people with disabilities.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">WCAG 2.2 (2021)</strong> The latest version, which places a spotlight on enhancing accessibility for cognitive and
      learning disabilities.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Looking Ahead - WCAG 3.0</strong> Expected to bring even more flexible guidelines,
      focus on diverse user needs, and offer improved testing methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What’s New in WCAG 2.2?</h2>
    <p>The WCAG 2.2 update introduces several key success criteria aimed at making the web more accessible than ever:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Focus Appearance:</strong> EEnsures that focus indicators are clearly visible, making it easier to navigate interactive elements.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Target Size for Dragging Movements:</strong> Adjusts criteria to ensure buttons, links, and other interactive elements are large enough for easy interaction.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Consistent help & Redudent Entry:</strong> Provides users with consistent help mechanisms across the site, reducing the need to re-enter information.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Accessibility Authentication:</strong> Simplifies login processes by eliminating the need for complex tasks or relying solely on memory.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These updates aren’t just incremental—they’re essential for creating a more inclusive web experience.</p>

    <h3>How to Integrate WCAG 2.2 into Your Workflow</h3>
    <p>Integrating WCAG 2.2 might seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. Here’s how you can start:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Conduct an Accessibility Audit:</strong> Start by evaluating your current site’s compliance with the latest WCAG standards. Identifying areas for improvement is the first step toward creating a more accessible website.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Leverage Tools like WAVE:</strong> Use the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) to pinpoint accessibility issues quickly and efficiently.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Prioritize New Success Criteria:</strong> Focus on ensuring visible focus indicators and appropriately sized interactive elements.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Download Our WCAG 2.2 Integration Checklist:</strong> Join our newsletter to get instant access to a comprehensive checklist designed to guide you through the integration process.</li>
