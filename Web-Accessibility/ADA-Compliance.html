      <h2 class="pb-3" id="content">Why Accessibility is important</h2>
      <p>There are at least three reasons that might motivate a company to create accessible web content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To improve the lives of people with disabilities <span class="text-muted"><i>(human-centered motivations)</i></span></li>
        <li>To capitalize on a wider audience or consumer base <span class="text-muted"><i>(marketing or economic-centered motivations)</i></span></li>
        <li>To avoid lawsuits and/or bad press <span class="text-muted"><i>(public relations and punishment-centered motivations)</i></span></li>
      </ul>

      <div class="lead text-center shadow-sm p-3 mt-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white rounded">
        <p class="display-4">Accessibility driven websites accomplish all these goals when people are at the center of the process.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The Kodemonkey team use the <strong><i>POUR</i></strong> principles set forth by the WCAG:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Perceivable</strong> - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)</li>
        <li><strong>Operable</strong> - User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform)</li>
        <li><strong>Understandable</strong> - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)</li>
        <li><strong>Robust</strong> - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)</li>

      </ul>

    <!--  <p>Those who are simply trying to avoid lawsuits realize they must be considered and addressed people with disabilities within their targeted audience.</p>  -->

      <h2>What is WCAG?</h2>

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a></strong>,
        developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world,
        to provide a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.</p>

      <p>The <strong>WCAG</strong> documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web "content" generally refers to the information no a web
        page or web application, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Natural information such as text, images, and sounds</li>
        <li>Code or markup that defines the structure, presentation, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <strong>WCAG</strong> is becoming a globally recognized voluntary consensus standard for web content. <strong>Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</strong>
      follows these guidelines for their <strong>VPAT documents</strong>.</p>

      <h2>What is Section 508?</h2>

      <div class="lead text-center shadow-sm p-3 mt-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white rounded">
        <p class="display-4">Is your business a federal agency, or do you receive funding/assistance from the federal government?</br />
          Then you are required to abide by section Section 508 requirements.</p>
      </div>

      <p>In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requiring Federal agencies to make electronic documents accessible to people with disabilities.
      <strong><a href="https://www.section508.gov/" title="GSA Government-wide IT Accessibility Program">Section 508</a></strong> applies to all Federal agencies when it pertains to electronic
      and information technology. Government agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to the same or comparable information as they do others.</p>

      <p>The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Access_Board" target="_blank">U.S. Access Board</a></strong> is responsible for developing accessibility standards that govern Federal
      procurement practices. January 2017, they issued a final rule that updated accessibility requirements for <strong>section 508</strong> and refreshed guidelines to <strong>Section 255</strong>.</p>

      <p>The refresh reorganized <strong>Section 508</strong> Standards and <strong>Section 255</strong> Guidelines in response to market trends and innovations in technology.
      The refresh also harmonized these requirements with other guidelines and standards both in the U.S. and abroad, including standards issued by the European Commission, and
      <strong>W3C</strong> guidelines know as <strong>WCAG</strong>.</p>

          <h3><strong>Let's Talk Litigations</strong></h3>

          <div class="lead text-center shadow-sm p-3 mt-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white rounded">
            <p class="display-4">It is important to understand that Kaffeinated Kodemonkey can not offer legal advice and advises you to seek legal
            counsel.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Being ADA Compliant is the only defense against litigations. It’s important to have a trusted third-party certification that validates
          your efforts.</p>

          <p>A website or app can fall out of compliance easily due to the product evolving through updates or additional content. These changes
          can cause your site to become vulnerable if you do not follow ADA requirements leaving your business open to the judge's discretion
          if taken to court.</p>

          <p>Why put your business at risk when you can have an Accessibility Partner in our corner.</p>

          <h3><strong>Become Digital Accessibility</strong></h3>

          <p>Getting certified isn’t just about displaying a badge on your website, it’s about the process of becoming compliant.</p>

          <p>It’s important to have a combination of software automation to detect compliance issues deep within a website and skilled human auditors
          doing a manual review because not all compliance issues can be detected or resolved through software alone.</p>

          <p>With our ADA Certification you get monthly accessibility monitoring and reports to keep you ahead of the game when any issues arise.</p>

          <p>Once your product is fully compliant you’re ready to proudly display a badge showing visitors your product is digitally accessible to
          those with disabilities as well as those without. And you can sleep at night knowing you have us watching your back.</p>
