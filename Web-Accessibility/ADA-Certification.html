      <p>Is your website ADA compliant? Do you have a VPAT certification? </p>

      <p>If not, you are putting your business at risk for an ADA Lawsuit.</p>

      <p>Being ADA Compliant is the only defense against litigations. It is imperative to have a trusted third-party VPAT Certification that
      validates your efforts.</p>

      <p>Digital content such as websites and applications fall under Title III which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in
      â€œplaces of public accommodation". New lawsuits indicate that private company websites, applications, online documents, and software qualify
      as places of public accommodation.</p>

      <h2>Put an Accessibility Partner in our corner.</h2>

      <p>Our team has developed a VPAT compliance certification process that verifies your website meets the WCAG and Section 508 requirements set
      forth by the W3C. You will receive:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>An Accessibility Report</li>
        <li>An Accessibility Statement</li>
        <li>A Certification badge</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Our packages are designed to fit any Accessibility needs. From VPAT completion to VPAT certification. Our experts monitor your
      accessibility, let you know when there are ADA compliance issues, and help you remedy them.</p>

      <p>At Kaffeinated Kodemonkey our mission is to develop and certify websites to be ADA Compliant by putting an Accessibility Expert in your
      corner so you can sleep at night.</p>

          <p>Are you completing an RFP or has your boss requested a VPAT to be completed?</p>

          <p>Many companies attempt to complete the VPAT on their own and tend to miss some issues due to a lack of understanding and knowledge of the WCAG requirements. Furthermore, the VPAT can be a bit confusing when it comes to filling it out.</p>

          <p>Don't waste your time and get frustrated let our qualified Accessibility Expert do this for you. Our team will analyze each page and test your site for hands-free access, vision impairedness, low-vision, color-blind, learning disabilities, deafness, low-hearing, and more through assistive technologies. Upon completion we will deliver a completed VPAT, indicating where your site passed and failed.</p>

          <p>You will be glad you did and you can rest assured that all issues will be notated and the VPAT will be completed accurately.</p>
