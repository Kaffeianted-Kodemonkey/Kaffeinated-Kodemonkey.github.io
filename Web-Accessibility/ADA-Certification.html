      <p>Why put your business at risk when you can have an Accessibility Partner in our corner.</p>

      <p>Being ADA Compliant is the only defense against litigations. It’s important to have a trusted third-party certification that validates
      your efforts.</p>

      <p>A website or app can fall out of compliance easily due to the product evolving through updates or additional content. These changes
      can cause your site to become vulnerable if you do not follow ADA requirements, leaving your business open to the judge's discretion
      if taken to court.</p>

      <h2>Become Digital Certified</h2>

      <p>Getting certified isn’t just about displaying a badge on your website, it’s about the process of becoming compliant.</p>

      <p>It’s important to have a combination of software automation to detect compliance issues deep within a website and skilled human auditors
      doing a manual review because not all compliance issues can be detected or resolved through software alone.</p>

      <p>Our team has developed a digital certification process that verifies your website meets the WCAG and Section 508 requirments
      set forth by the W3C:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Evaluate your site agaist the latest guidelines</li>
        <li>Work with your team to resolve accessibility issues</li>
        <li>Provide documentation validating your compliants leve</li>
        <li>Provide a badge displaying the date of your compliance</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Once your product is fully compliant you’re ready to proudly display a badge showing visitors your product is digitally accessible to
      to all your visitors. And, best of all, you can sleep at night knowing you have us watching your back.</p>

      <p>At Kaffeinated Kodemonkey it is our mission to develop and certify websites to be ADA Compliant.</p>

      <h2>What is an Accessibility Report?</h2>

      <p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey uses the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (<span class="text-uppercase"><strong>VPAT</strong></span>)
      for our Accessibiltiy Report to validate your the accessible of your website/application, software, or electronic document.</p>

      <p>The VPAT is a self-disclosing document which details each aspect of the WCAG & Section 508 requirements and how the product supports
      each criteria. All sections of the VPAT must conform to these requirements in order for your website/application, software, or electronic document
      to be consider compliant.</p>

      <p>VPAT's are complex, confusing, and time-consuming. Often time the person who receives a VPAT has difficulty understand and interpret the
      document and its requirements. This can be frustrating if you don't have an accessibility specialist on staff. Kaffeinated Kodemonkey has a
      team of experts to handle this for you.</p>

          <p>Most businesses that require a VPAT are because they were asked to show proof of accessibility. They are either working with a government
          entity or submitting a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it requires a VPAT to be included. We also recommend that you obtain a VPAT for your
          product if it is being marketed to the Federal Government or the educational sector for they will require a VPAT to work with or use your
          product.</p>

          <p>When a company attempts to complete the <strong>VPAT</strong> on their own they may not be completely honest and list all the issues
          even if they are minor because it can mean additional work for the team or maybe they do not fully understand how to resolve the issue.
          By hiring a third party you can rest assured that all issues will be notated accurately. Kaffeinated Kodemonkey's team will stand with
          you and help in the remediation process.</p>

          <p>Let our team of accessibility experts complete the <strong>VPAT</strong> for you. We will analyze each page and test your site for
          hands-free access, vision impairedness, low-vision, color-blind, learning disabilities, deafness, low-hearing, and more through assistive
          technologies. Upon completion we will deliver a completed VPAT, indicating where your site passed and failed.</p>
