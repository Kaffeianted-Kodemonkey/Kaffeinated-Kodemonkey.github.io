      <h2 class="pb-3" id="content">What is a VPAT?</h2>

      <p>A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (<span class="text-uppercase"><strong>VPAT</strong></span>) is a document that outlines how accessible a
      particular website, application or software or electronic document is according to the WCAG & Section 508 Standards. It is a self-disclosing document which
      details each aspect of the WCAG & Section 508 requirements and how the product supports each criteria.</p>

      <p>The VPAT document follows on the WCAG Guidelines for criteria and requires all sections to conform to these requirements for each level (A, AA, AAA)
      of conformance as well as the European Accessibility standards EN 301.</p>

      <p>VPAT's are complex, confusing, and time-consuming. Often time the person who receives a VPAT has difficulty understand and interpret the document and
      its requirements. This can be frustrating if you don't have an accessibility specialist on staff. Kaffeinated Kodemonkey has a team of experts to handle
      this for you.</p>

      <h2>Who needs a VPAT?</h2>
      <p>Most businesses that require a VPAT are because they were asked to show proof of accessibility. They are etiehr working with a government entity or submitting
      a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it requires a VPAT to be included.</p>

      <p>We recommend that you obtain a VPAT for the product that is being marketed to the Federal Government or the educational sector for they will require aVPAT to work with or use your product.</p>

          <h3><strong>VPAT Audit</strong></h3>

          <p>Essentially you have been asked either by your boss, prospective client, or you are a go-getter and have chosen to be proactive and fill out a
          <strong>VPAT</strong> Document for your product to demonstrate your current <strong>WCAG</strong> conformance Level.</p>

          <p>When a company attempts to complete the <strong>VPAT</strong> on their own they may not be completely honest and list all the issues even if they are minor because it
          can mean additional work for the team or maybe they do not fully understand how to resolve the issue. By hiring a third party you can rest assured that
          all issues will be notated accurately. Kaffeinated Kodemonkey's team will stand with you and help in the remediation process.</p>

          <p>Let our team of accessibility experts complete the <strong>VPAT</strong> for you. We will analyze each page and test your site for hands-free access, vision impairedness,
          low-vision, color-blind, learning disabilities, deafness, low-hearing, and more through assistive technologies. Upon completion we will deliver a completed
          VPAT, indicating where your site passed and failed.</p>

          <h3><strong>Let's Talk Litigations</strong></h3>

          <div class="lead text-center shadow-sm p-3 mt-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white rounded">
            <p class="display-4">It is important to understand that Kaffeinated Kodemonkey can not offer legal advice and advises you to seek legal
            counsel.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Becoming ADA Compliant is the only defense from litigation and it’s important to have a trusted third-party certification that can validate your compliance.</p>

          <p>A website or app can fall out of compliance easily due to the nature of the product evolving through updates or additional content, and structure/code
          updates causing you to become vulnerable to lawsuits. Thus your certification will be stamped with the date of last confirmed compliance and we strongly recommend
          our compliance management to help you stay compliant as your product evolves.</p>

          <p>With our ongoing compliance management service, you get monthly reports and manual human audits including re-certification every 6 months.</p>

          <h3><strong>Become Digital Accessibility</strong></h3>

          <p>Getting certified isn’t just about displaying a badge on your website, it’s about the process of getting it compliant.</p>

          <p>Most websites and apps have millions of lines of code. It’s important to have a combination of software automation to detect compliance issues deep
          within a website and skilled human auditors doing a manual review because not all compliance issues can be detected or resolved through software alone.</p>

          <p>Once your product is fully compliant you’re ready to proudly display a badge showing visitors your product is digitally accessible to those with disabilities
          as well as those without.</p>
