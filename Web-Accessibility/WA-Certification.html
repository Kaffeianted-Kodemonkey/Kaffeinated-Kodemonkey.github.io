<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey is driven to help companies meet WCAG & Section 508 requirments in become ADA complant.
That is why we offer a Web Accessibilty Certification. It is our commitment to helping you stay above the competition .</p>

<h3><strong>Let's Talk Litigations</strong></h3>

<p>Being ADA Compliant is the only defense against litigations. It’s important to have a trusted third-party certification that validates
your efforts.</p>

<p>A website or app can fall out of compliance easily due to the product evolving through updates or additional content. These changes
can cause your site to become vulnerable if you do not follow ADA requirements leaving your business open to the judge's discretion
if taken to court.</p>

<p>Why put your business at risk when you can have an Accessibility Partner in our corner.</p>

<h3><strong>Become Digitally Accessibile</strong></h3>
<p>With our WA-Certification you get monthly monitoring reports to keep you ahead of the game when issues arise.</p>

<p>Our certification badge, Accessibilty Statement, and Accessibilty Compliance Report will have you armed with the content you need to
show visitors your product is digitally accessible to everyone no matter their dissability.</p>

<p>Getting certified isn’t about displaying a badge or report on your website, it’s about the process of becoming compliant.</p>

<p>It’s important to have a combination of software automation, to detect compliance issues deep within a website, and skilled human auditors
doing a manual review, because not all compliance issues can be detected or resolved through software alone.</p>

<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey want you to sleep at night knowing you have a trused partner watching your back.</p>
