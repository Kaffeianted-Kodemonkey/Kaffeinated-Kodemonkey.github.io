            <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are global standards created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make web content—like text, images, and videos—accessible to people with disabilities, such as visual, auditory, or motor impairments. WCAG’s four principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) ensure websites are usable for everyone, including the 26% of U.S. adults with disabilities (per CDC). In the U.S., Section 508 requires federal websites to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A/AA standards.

            What is ADA compliance?
          </button>
        </h3>

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>ADA compliance refers to meeting the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a U.S. federal law enacted in 1990 to prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities. For web accessibility, it ensures digital content—like websites, apps, and PDFs—is usable by individuals with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments (e.g., 26% of U.S. adults, per CDC). While the ADA doesn’t explicitly define web standards, Titles II and III often apply: Title II requires state/local government websites to be accessible, and Title III applies to public-facing businesses. Courts increasingly interpret ADA compliance as meeting WCAG 2.1 Level A/AA standards, similar to Section 508 for federal agencies (which mandates WCAG 2.0 A/AA). Non-compliance risks lawsuits or penalties. Practical steps include adding alt text, ensuring keyboard navigation, and testing with tools like WAVE.

            <p>A Proof of Compliance Certificate (POCC) is a formal document issued by Kaffeinated Kodemonkey to
            demonstrate that your website, app, or digital content meets web accessibility standards like WCAG 2.1/2.2
            Level AA and Section 508. </p>

            <p>It provides evidence of audits, testing (e.g., with screen readers like NVDA), remediation, and conformance,
            helping reduce legal risks under the ADA (Titles II/III) for businesses and federal contractors. Unlike a VPAT
            (used for product procurement), a POCC focuses on ongoing compliance proof. </p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> No official "ADA certification" exists, but a POCC shows good-faith efforts. </p>

            <p>Accessibility (A11y) improves SEO by making your website easier for search engines like Google to understand and rank. Adding alt text to images gives search crawlers keyword-rich content to index. Using clear, structured HTML helps Google navigate your site. Features like captions for videos and easy navigation make your site more user-friendly, keeping visitors longer and reducing bounce rates. This broader reach, including to the 26% of U.S. adults with disabilities (per CDC), boosts traffic and engagement, signaling quality to search engines. Accessible sites also load faster and work better on mobile, both key for SEO.</p>

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>HB21-1110 compliance refers to Colorado's House Bill 21-1110, a 2021 law making the state the first to mandate that all state and local government websites, digital content, and software be accessible to people with disabilities. It prohibits discrimination by ensuring equitable access to services, aligning with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (similar to Section 508 but for Colorado entities like schools and agencies). The deadline is July 1, 2025 (extended from 2024 for good-faith efforts), with non-compliance risking civil rights violations, fines up to $3,500 per issue, or court orders. This benefits the 26% of U.S. adults with disabilities (per CDC) by improving usability on government sites.</p>

            <p>Section 508 compliance refers to meeting the accessibility requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a U.S. federal law mandating that Information and Communication Technology (ICT)—like websites, apps, PDFs, and software—used by federal agencies and contractors be accessible to people with disabilities. It adopts WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA standards for web content, ensuring usability for the 26% of U.S. adults with disabilities (per CDC). This includes features like alt text for images, keyboard navigation, and captions for videos. Compliance often requires a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) to document adherence. Non-compliance risks contract penalties or legal issues.</p> <!-- join our newsletter, or visit our MonkeyHub for valuable insights and updates on web accessibility.-->
