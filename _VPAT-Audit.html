    <h2>What is a VPAT Audit</h2>
    <p>A <strong>VPAT</strong> (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) Audit is a structured evaluation that assesses how well your website meets
    established accessibility standards. The audit results in a <strong>VPAT document</strong>, a formal report detailing your site’s compliance
    with key guidelines, including WCAG, Section 508, and EN 301 549.</p>

    <p>For organizations that need to demonstrate accessibility, especially when responding to <strong>Requests for Proposals (RFPs)</strong>,
    a VPAT Audit is essential. Many <strong>government agencies, educational institutions,</strong> and <strong>corporations</strong>
    require a VPAT to ensure digital products or services are accessible.</p>

    <p>Conducting a VPAT Audit identifies gaps in accessibility, helping you develop a strategic roadmap for improvement. Particularly valuable
    for organizations engaging in federal contracts, a VPAT demonstrates compliance with Section 508 and is vital for showing commitment to
    accessibility.</p>
