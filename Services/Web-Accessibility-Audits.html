<p>Future-proof your website, slash legal risk, unlock new revenue streams, and actually deliver inclusive experiences with an expert accessibility audit from me — Kaffeinated Kodemonkey.</p>

<p>Every single audit is manually evaluated by a DHS Certified Trusted Tester (that’s me) using my battle-tested in-house process that follows the Trusted Tester Conformance Test Process to the letter. No “run an automated scanner and call it a day” nonsense here. You get clear, actionable remediation plans that developers actually love, plus gorgeous public-facing documentation you’ll want to show off.</p>


<div class="alert alert-primary mt-4 text-center">
  <p><strong>Most private-sector and SaaS clients kick things off with the POCC Package.<br />
  Higher-ed and public-sector folks usually jump straight to the SAR Package.<br />
  80% of clients upgrade to the full SAR Package within 12 months</p>

<h2>What the deliverables actually mean</h2>
<h3>Proof of Compliance Certificate (POCC)</h3>
<p>A branded, public-facing certificate and seal you can display on your site stating it has been manually
tested by a DHS Certified Trusted Tester and conforms to WCAG 2.X AA (or the level achieved). Perfect for marketing,
building user trust, and satisfying most private-sector due-diligence Accessibility requirements.</p>

<h3>Section 508 Accessibility Report (SAR)</h3>
<p>The complete, procurement-ready report required by federal agencies, most state governments, higher-education
institutions, and large enterprises. Includes a formal cover letter, executive summary, testing methodology,
annotated findings with screenshots and code examples, and a signed certification page from a DHS Certified
Trusted Tester.</p>
