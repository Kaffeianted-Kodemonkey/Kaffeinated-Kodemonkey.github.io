    technology ensure accuracy across devices, including mobile and assistive technologies.<p>

    <h2>VPAT Only</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Our <strong>Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)</strong> is a standalone offering for organizations
    needing precise, compliance-ready documentation without a full audit. A <strong>VPAT</strong> details your website,
    app, or digital product’s conformance with <strong>WCAG 2.1/2.2</strong> and <strong>Section 508</strong>, making it
    essential for federal contractors, government RFPs, or procurement processes. Our DHS Certified Trusted Testers
    conduct a focused evaluation to complete the VPAT, assessing key accessibility features like keyboard navigation,
    alt text, and new WCAG 2.2 criteria (e.g., 2.5.7 Dragging Movements, 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication).</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accuracy and Speed:</strong> Delivered in 3-5 days, our VPATs are thorough, reflecting your product’s accessibility status with detailed conformance notes.</li>
      <li><strong>xProcurement Advantage:</strong> Meets federal and state requirements (e.g., Section 508, EAA), increasing your chances of winning contracts.</li>
      <li><strong>Customized Scope:</strong> We tailor VPATs for specific products (e.g., websites, apps, PDFs) or entire systems, ensuring relevance for your RFP.</li>
      <li><strong>Path to Full Compliance:</strong> A VPAT can be your first step toward a comprehensive POCC, with optional audit upgrades to address identified issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Expert Support:</strong> Includes a consultation to explain findings and next steps, ensuring you understand compliance gaps.</li>

<h2>Invest in a Web Accessibility Audit</h2>
<p>A <strong>web accessibility audit</strong> ensures compliance with the <strong><a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a></strong>,
<strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG)</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.section508.gov/" target="_blank">Section 508</a></strong>,
reducing legal risks and improving user experience. Over 8,800 ADA Title III lawsuits targeted websites in 2024,
with fines up to $75,000 for first violations (Seyfarth Shaw, 2024; DOJ, 2014). Accessibility also unlocks a $2.6
trillion disposable income market held by people with disabilities (Return on Disability Group, 2024).</p>

<p>Our DHS Certified Trusted Testers use manual testing (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) and tools like WAVE and axe to identify
barriers for users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments, ensuring <strong>WCAG 2.2 Level AA</strong>
compliance, including new criteria like focus visibility (2.4.11) and accessible authentication (3.3.8). Audits boost
SEO rankings through keyword-rich alt text, semantic HTML, and mobile-friendly design, aligning with Google’s Core Web
Vitals. Clients see 15-25% organic traffic growth in 3 months (HubSpot, 2023).</p>
