<h2>What is a Proof of Compliance Certificate (POCC)?</h2>
<p>A <strong><em>Proof of Compliance Certificate (POCC)</em></strong> verifies that your digital assets — websites,
applications, or documents — meet standards like Section 508 Compliance and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
Our process includes comprehensive website accessibility audits, detailed reporting, and a certificate validating compliance.
This credential supports regulatory requirements, procurement processes, or public accountability, including alignment
