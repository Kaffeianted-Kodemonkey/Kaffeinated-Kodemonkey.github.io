<h2>Invest in a Web Accessibility Audit</h2>
<p>A <strong>web accessibility audit</strong> ensures compliance with the <strong><a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a></strong>,
<strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG)</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.section508.gov/" target="_blank">Section 508</a></strong>,
reducing legal risks and improving user experience. Over 8,800 ADA Title III lawsuits targeted websites in 2024,
with fines up to $75,000 for first violations (Seyfarth Shaw, 2024; DOJ, 2014). Accessibility also unlocks a $2.6
trillion disposable income market held by people with disabilities (Return on Disability Group, 2024).</p>

<p>Our DHS Certified Trusted Testers use manual testing (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) and tools like WAVE and axe to identify
barriers for users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments, ensuring <strong>WCAG 2.2 Level AA</strong>
compliance, including new criteria like focus visibility (2.4.11) and accessible authentication (3.3.8). Audits boost
SEO rankings through keyword-rich alt text, semantic HTML, and mobile-friendly design, aligning with Google’s Core Web
Vitals. Clients see 15-25% organic traffic growth in 3 months (HubSpot, 2023).</p>
