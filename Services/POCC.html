<h2>What is a Proof of Compliance Certificate (POCC)?</h2>
<p>A <strong><em>Proof of Compliance Certificate (POCC)</em></strong> verifies that your digital assets — websites, applications, or documents — meet standards like Section 508 and WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). Our process begins with a preliminary assessment and a VPAT to evaluate your platform’s accessibility, followed by a comprehensive expert audit, a detailed report, and a certificate validating compliance. This credential supports regulatory requirements, procurement processes, or public accountability, including alignment with Colorado’s HB21-1110 for government entities. Whether you start with a VPAT or seek full certification, our POCC ensures compliance with confidence.</p>
