<h3>Why Compliance Matters</h3>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates equal digital access for public entities (Title II) and private businesses (Title III). The DOJ’s 2024 Web Rule (effective April 2026 for Title II) references WCAG 2.1 AA, while our POCC ensures WCAG 2.X compliance, offering stronger evidence of accessibility to reduce legal risks. Section 508 requires WCAG 2.0 AA for federal agencies and contractors, and our DHS Trusted Tester audits provide robust compliance documentation. While compliance doesn’t eliminate lawsuits (e.g., over 3,000 ADA website cases in 2022), a POCC strengthens your defense and demonstrates inclusivity.</p>

<h3>What is a POCC?</h3>
<p>A Proof of Compliance Certificate (POCC) is your official validation that your website or digital product meets ADA,
WCAG 2.X, and Section 508 standards, ensuring usability for people with disabilities. Issued after our DHS Trusted Tester
audits, including VPATs for RFPs/contracts and a Disability Impact Score to quantify inclusivity, it’s a recognized badge
of compliance for regulators, clients, and search engines. Our POCC positions your organization as a leader in accessible
design, driving client growth and trust.</p>

<h4>Benefits of a POCC</h4>
