<h2 class="mb-3">Proof of Compliance (POCC) – <span class="fs-4 align-middle text-black"><em><strong>Verify Your Compliance</strong></em></span></h2>
<p>Secure official verification that your website meets HB21-1110, ADA, WCAG 2.2, and Section 508 standards. Backed by our DHS Trusted Tester audits,
the POCC includes VPATs for RFPs/contracts, supporting documents, and a Disability Impact Score to quantify compliance levels. Ideal for Colorado
government, education, and businesses, it minimizes post-July 2025 legal risks like OIT audits and $3,500/violation fines while improving SEO and
user access.</p>

<h4>Additional Services (POCC Included):</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Accessibility Monitoring – Continuous checks for websites and Canvas LMS.</li>

<h3>Why Compliance Matters</h3>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires equal digital access for public entities (Title II) and private businesses (Title III).
Colorado's HB21-1110 mandates WCAG 2.1 AA for state/local sites, with full enforcement since July 2025—exposing non-compliant agencies to OIT
audits and fines up to $3,500/violation. Federally, Section 508 demands WCAG 2.0 AA for agencies/contractors, while the DOJ’s 2024 Web Rule
(effective April 2026 for Title II) aligns with WCAG 2.1 AA. Our POCC provides ironclad documentation to defend against the 3,000+ ADA website
lawsuits filed in 2022, proving your commitment to standards.</p>

<h3>What is a POCC?</h3>
<p>A Proof of Compliance Certificate (POCC) officially validates that your website or digital product meets HB21-1110, ADA, WCAG 2.2, and Section 508
standards for full usability. Issued after our DHS Trusted Tester audits, it includes VPATs for RFPs/contracts and a Disability Impact Score
(e.g., 98% conformance rating) to benchmark your site's performance. Display it as a compliance badge for regulators, clients, and search
engines—strengthening your position in bids and reducing audit exposure.</p>
