    <h2>What is a VPAT Audit</h2>
    <p>A <strong>VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)</strong> Audit is a specialized evaluation that helps you assess how well your
    website meets accessibility standards. The VPAT document is a formal report that outlines your site’s compliance with key accessibility guidelines,
    including WCAG, Section 508, and EN 301 549. A <strong>VPAT Audit</strong> involves a detailed review of your website's digital accessibility
    and provides a transparent, structured assessment of where your site stands in terms of compliance.</p>

    <p>This audit is crucial for organizations that need to demonstrate their commitment to accessibility, especially when responding to
    <strong>Requests for Proposals (RFPs)</strong>. Many government agencies, educational institutions, and large corporations require a
    VPAT to ensure that the digital products or services they purchase are fully accessible.</p>

    <p>Conducting a VPAT Audit not only identifies areas where your site may not meet required standards but also provides a strategic roadmap for
    addressing these gaps. This can be particularly important when working with government entities, as compliance with Section 508 is mandatory for
    federal contracts, and the VPAT is a necessary document for proving compliance.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, a VPAT Audit empowers your organization with the information needed to address accessibility barriers and ensures that you can
    confidently report your site’s compliance to stakeholders or regulatory bodies.</p>

    <h3>What’s Included in the VPAT Audit?</h3>
    <p>Our <strong>VPAT Audit</strong> goes beyond the surface to give you a full understanding of your website’s accessibility status. We assess
    your site’s performance against WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), Section 508, and EN 301 549 standards, providing a detailed compliance
    report. This evaluation is designed to identify any barriers that may hinder users with disabilities and offer a clear action plan to help you
    meet accessibility standards.</p>

    <p>The audit results in a roadmap that outlines actionable steps to improve your website’s accessibility, ensuring that every visitor,
    regardless of ability, has a positive experience.</p>

    <h3>The Benefits of an VPAT Audit</h3>
    <p>An VPAT Audit is more than just a compliance check. It provides legal protection by ensuring your website meets federal and international
    accessibility laws, which can help avoid potential lawsuits or penalties. Additionally, it creates an opportunity to enhance your website’s
    user experience. An accessible website improves usability for all visitors, including those with disabilities, and fosters greater engagement
    and satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Beyond accessibility, an inclusive website can improve your search engine optimization (SEO) rankings. Accessibility and SEO often go hand
    in hand, and improving your site’s accessibility can contribute to higher visibility and better search engine performance.</p>

<!--<h2>SEO Boost</h2>

<p>Accessibility not only helps improve ROI
through on-page SEO by making your content discoverable and understandable by users and search engine bots but also enhances the overall user experience, making it perceivable,
operable, understandable, and robust. This, in turn, increases your site's organic traffic.</p>

<p>Moreover, web accessibility and SEO go hand in hand. By adhering to the W3C's POUR principles, which focus on Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust design,
you position your website for success in both accessibility and SEO. An accessibility-first approach naturally fosters excellent SEO practices, as it provides search engines
with additional information about your site and pages, enabling them to display search results that accurately match user queries.</p>

<p>If you are seeking support from shareholders or require additional marketing budgets, emphasizing accessibility can be advantageous. A VPAT can effectively demonstrate the
accessibility status and highlight any existing issues, facilitating conversations with management or shareholders about the importance of becoming ADA compliant. For government
entities, compliance with Section 508 is a mandatory requirement.</p> -->
