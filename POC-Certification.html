<p>A POC Certification is a set of documents outlining your ADA Compliance Stratus.</p>

<p>Digital content, such as websites, kiosks, applications, PDFs, and any online content, is considered ICT (information and communications technology)
by default, placing it under Title III,  prohibiting discrimination based on disability in "places of public accommodation.". In other words, businesses
are moving to a digital platform, and the ADA rules are shifting to ensure everyone receives an equal experience whather online or offline.</p>

<p>With a POC Certification, you can show visitors you value accessibility and want them to have an exceptional experience. Furthermore, you will have
documentation showing your product's compliance level, how your company is handling none compliance issues, and who to contact if they are having trouble
accessing or navigating the product.</p>

<h4>Who is this for?</h4>
