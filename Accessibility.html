    <h1><u>Proof Of Compliance (POC) Certificate</u></h1>

    <p>This website holds a POC Certificate from Kaffeinated Kodemonkey demonstrating compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.</p>

    <p>A POC Certificate is a valuable tool for assessing the accessibility of a product. It's worth noting that, even if a product meets all
    technical requirements, users with disabilities may still face challenges based on the nature or severity of their disability.</p>

    <p>Conversely, a product that doesn't fully conform to all technical requirements can still be highly accessible if it doesn't require
    specific accessibility features, such as large buttons or hearing aids for individuals with hearing disabilities.</p>

    <p>While achieving absolute accessibility perfection may be challenging, many products can effectively serve most people with disabilities.
    The POC Certificate reflects our commitment to ADA compliance and conformity with WCAG/508 2.1 Level AA requirements.</p>

    <p>At Kaffeinated Kodemonkey we help clients meet State and/or WCAG requirements with a team of DHS Certified Trusted Testers that
    collaborates closely to ensure the product is accessible to all audiences and adheres to Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
    and Section 508 requirements for Level AA standards.</p>

    <p>For those of you using a screen reader or navigating without a mouse, you have the option to skip straight to the content by clicking "Skip to main content".</p>

    <h4>Magnify the screen</h4>
    <p>Many web browsers allow you to zoom in on web pages using simple keyboard controls. The magnifier allows you to focus on specific parts of the screen, enlarging the text and other page elements.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For Windows operating systems, press Ctrl and + to zoom in on a web page (Ctrl and ‚Äì to zoom out)</li>
      <li>For Mac operating systems, press Cmd and + to zoom in on a Web page (Cmd and ‚Äì to zoom out)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Customize the mouse pointer</h4>
    <p>You can customize a computer mouse pointer in several ways. For example, you can slow down the speed of the mouse pointer for easier handling. You can also change its appearance so that it contrasts more with the screen content.</p>
