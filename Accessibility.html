<h1><u>Proof Of Compliance (POC) Certificate</u></h1>

<p>This website proudly holds a Proof of Compliance (POC) Certificate from Kaffeinated Kodemonkey, demonstrating adherence to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.</p>
<p>A POC Certificate is a valuable tool for evaluating the accessibility of a product. It's crucial to recognize that even if a product meets all technical requirements, users with disabilities may still encounter challenges based on the nature or severity of their disability.</p>
<p>Conversely, a product that doesn't fully conform to all technical requirements can still be highly accessible if it doesn't necessitate specific accessibility features, such as large buttons or hearing aids for individuals with hearing disabilities.</p>
<p>While achieving absolute accessibility perfection may be challenging, many products can effectively serve most people with disabilities. The POC Certificate reflects our unwavering commitment to ADA compliance and conformity with WCAG/508 2.1 Level AA requirements.</p>
<p>At Kaffeinated Kodemonkey, we assist clients in meeting State and/or WCAG requirements with a team of DHS Certified Trusted Testers who collaborate closely to ensure the product is accessible to all audiences. Our dedication extends to adhering to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Section 508 requirements for Level AA standards, as evidenced by the following documents:</p>

    </ul>
