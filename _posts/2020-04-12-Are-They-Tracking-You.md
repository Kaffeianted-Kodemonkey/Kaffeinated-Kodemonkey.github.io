<p>Can and does the Gov spy on their people. Yes in almost everything we do. If you work and pay taxes, do you have an SS#, buy a car, register it, have a driver's license, you vote, etc.. the list can go one.</p>

<h2>They are tracking you.</h2>

<p>Yes, Facebook and Google like to know what you are doing online so they can sell your data or use location tracking to push ads to you. Don't get me wrong, I understand the personal property and invasion of personal space. The way I see it, don't go online if you are that concerned about big brother watching your every move. Just my view or was...</p>

<h2>So what Changed?</h2>

<p>Over the past week, I have been getting an emergency alert warning to fill out a declaration of entry if I plan to travel into Utah. For those of you that don't know, I live in a rural town that borders Utah. It is closer for me to travel to Utah for my shopping then 1+ hours to another town in my state.</p>

<p>My first thought was, "No way am I filling out that declaration!!! It is none of their business of my health history or my travels." My second thought was, "How the hell did they know to send me the alert?". Well, I had just been in Utah a few days before for groceries. They can track what towers my phone is pinging, and there you have it.</p>

<p>So why the sudden change of mind? From a programmers point of view, the platform and storage compacity need to store data on a mass scale is not ready. This is shown by requests for COBOL programmers due to gov. systems crashing. And this Utah declaration of travel.</p>

<p>I feel due to COVID-19 we are going to see a new normal and more gov. control or push for control. I believe that they will use this time to implement a process that will overall track our every move more than we could think.</p>

<h2>They are getting ready</h2>

<p>I am not here to push some conspiracy theory or fear. I just want to share what I see, and my opinion, what may be on the horizon.  Here is what I see:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thousands of gov. computers run on an outdated programming language called COBOL and are struggling to keep up.
  The Utah governor is pushing for us to sign a declaration of travel.</li>
  <li>In the news, we find out that Facebook and Google are donating money to Microsoft who in turn want to chip us through forced vaccination.</li>
  <li>ZOOM is not fully encrypted as they said and pass our data through china who has the right to view the "encrypted data at will"</li>
  <li>These are items that should be alarming and personally concerning, however, the one thing that got me more concerned is the technology we all have in our hands, pockets, and bags. Phone & Tablets.</li>
</ul>

<p>I read an article the other day about Google and Apple pushing out an app allowing notifying you if you have come in contact with a person that has tested positive for COVID-19. Over time they will start to integrate this into your phones os on updates and the default will be to allow. You will have to go into the system and disable it. But this may only be a false disable as it will not notify you but will still track your moves.</p>

<p>I personally do not want anyone to know my travels unless I personally tell them. My med history is my business, not the gov or strangers. I believe this is the first step to government overreach.</p>

<h2>Be Smart and don't overreact</h2>
<p>How can we safeguard our travels and lives? I am not suggesting we ditch the internet and go back to landlines, although you can if you feel compelled to do so.</p>

<p>Here are some tool/ways you can keep your life as is and safeguard your privacy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Browser - use the privacy or incognito settings in Firefox and Chrome.  Or use <a href="https://brave-browser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="blank">Brave</a> or <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?va=z&t=hk" target="blank">DuckDuckGo</a></li>
  <li>Search Engines - That respect your privacy:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://duckduckgo.com/" targe="blank">DuckDuckGo</a>: DuckDuckGo is a popular search engine for the privacy-conscious.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.startpage.com/" targe="blank">Startpage</a>: If you prefer Google’s search results and just want more privacy, try Ixquick’s Startpage.</li>
    <li><a href="https://ixquick.com/" targe="blank">Ixquick</a>: Ixquick is the main search engine from the company that runs Startpage. Unlike Startpage, Ixquick pulls results from a variety of sources instead of only Google.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plugins: I use Facebook Container on Firefox to block Facebook from tracking me around the web.</li>
  <li>Shut of Tracking: There are many articles about this. One I read is from <a href="https://www.komando.com/smartphones-gadgets/8-ways-to-stop-your-phone-from-tracking-you/543526/?fbclid=IwAR34TDqjgWhOfwB1RxUC8olGDr92q_g9NiYp0Qq3k1bKE9a_gJuOBSUtpt0" target="blank">LifeHacker</a> and it walks you through in-depth how to turn off all tracking on your phone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As an American citizen, I believe strongly in the constitution and my right to privacy that I will be making choices to stay in state and support our local communities, keep my data private and in doing so I will turn off all location/tracking on my phone, installing DuckDuckGo as my default browser and search engine, and shut my phone off or leave it at home when I travel short distances.</p>
