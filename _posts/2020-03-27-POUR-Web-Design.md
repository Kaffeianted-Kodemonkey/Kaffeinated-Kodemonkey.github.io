<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey is an Accessibility Driven web agency. Our goal is to develop websites with all users in mind no matter the disability or technology. </p>

<p>But what does all that mean? In other words, our focus is on building websites that are ADA compliant or accessible to people with a disability. From a platform designed around accessibility to making sure our client's content is accessible.</p>

<p>We do this through a process called <strong>POUR Web design</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>WCAG</strong> put forth principles to follow when developing websites for ADA compliance and each principal has a set of guidelines.</p>

<h2>The WCAG Principles and guidelines</h2>

<p>Each principle has a set of guidelines that are broken down into what is known as WCAG Criteria. At Kaffeinated Kodemonkey we design, build, certify and validate websites based on these principles and their guidelines to make sure all sites are are ADA compliant and as a business you are reaching all your visitors where they are.</p>

<p>The Principles are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><u><strong>P</strong>erceivable</u>: Capable of being perceived especially by sight or hearing. In other words, the user can understand the content of the website.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#alternatives" target="blank">Text alternatives for non-text content</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#captions" target="blank">Captions and other alternatives for multimedia</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#adaptable" target="blank">Content can be presented in different ways</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#distinguishable" target="blank">Content is easier to see and hear</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u><strong>O</strong>perable</u>: The user can interact or use the website as it is designed:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#keyboard" target="blank">Functionality is available from a keyboard</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#time" target="blank">Users have enough time to read and use the content</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#safe" target="blank">Content does not cause seizures and physical reactions</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#navigable" target="blank">Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#modalities" target="blank">Users can use different input modalities beyond keyboard</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u><strong>U</strong>nderstandable</u> The website is clear and the user can understand what is being displayed and how to interact:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#readable" target="blank">Text is readable and understandable</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#predictable" target="blank">Content appears and operates in predictable ways</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#tolerant" target="blank">Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u><strong>R</strong>obust</u>: The website is designed as such that the user can use assistive technologies to engage with the site:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#compatible" target="blank">Content is compatible with current and future user tools</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
