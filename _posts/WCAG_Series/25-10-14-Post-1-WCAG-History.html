    <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), provide a
    framework to make web content accessible to people with disabilities. Conformance to WCAG means your website meets
    specific accessibility standards, ensuring it’s usable by as many people as possible, including those with visual,
    auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. Conformance is measured through success criteria, which are specific,
    testable requirements organized under WCAG’s four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.
    These criteria are grouped into three conformance levels—A, AA, and AAA—each representing a progressively higher
    standard of accessibility. Understanding these levels helps you prioritize accessibility improvements and meet
    legal requirements, such as those in Section 508 or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In this post, we’ll
    break down the three WCAG conformance levels, explain their differences, and share practical tips to get started.
    This is part of our series on WCAG 2.1, so check out our other posts for more on making your website inclusive!</p>

    <h2>Why Conformance Matters</h2>
    <p>Conforming to WCAG levels ensures your website is inclusive, legally compliant, and user-friendly. It reduces
    the risk of lawsuits (e.g., under ADA Title III for businesses), improves SEO (search engines favor accessible sites),
    and builds trust with your audience. Plus, accessibility benefits everyone—clear navigation helps distracted users,
    captions aid in noisy environments, and keyboard support improves efficiency.</p>

    <h2>The Three WCAG Conformance Levels</h2>
    <div class="accordion my-3" id="accordionExample">
      <div class="accordion-item mb-2">
        <h2 class="accordion-header">

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Level A is the baseline for accessibility. It includes the most basic requirements that a website must meet to be
            minimally accessible. Think of it as the foundation—essential but not sufficient for full inclusivity.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>What it covers:</strong> Level A success criteria address critical barriers to access. Examples include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Providing text alternatives for images (e.g., alt text for screen readers).</li>
                  <li>Ensuring all functionality is available via keyboard (e.g., no mouse-only actions).</li>
                  <li>Avoiding content that causes seizures (e.g., no rapidly flashing elements).</li>
                </ul>
              <li><strong>Who it helps:</strong> Users with severe disabilities, such as those who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation.</li>
              <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Level A alone doesn’t provide a great user experience for most people with disabilities. It’s a starting point, not the goal.</li>
              <li><strong>Example:</strong> Adding alt text like alt="A smiling dog sitting on grass" to an image ensures screen reader users understand the content, meeting a Level A criterion (1.1.1 Non-text Content).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Meeting Level A prevents the worst accessibility failures, but it’s rarely enough for legal compliance or broad usability.</p>

            Level AA: The Common Target

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Level AA builds on Level A, adding requirements to make content more usable and inclusive. This is the most
            commonly targeted level for websites, as it balances practicality with meaningful accessibility improvements.
            Many laws, like Section 508 in the U.S., reference WCAG 2.0 or 2.1 Level AA as a standard.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>What it covers:</strong> Level AA addresses a wider range of disabilities and user needs. Examples include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Ensuring sufficient color contrast (e.g., 4.5:1 for text, making it readable for low-vision users).</li>
                  <li>Providing captions for pre-recorded videos.</li>
                  <li>Making navigation consistent and predictable across pages.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Who it helps:</strong> Users with moderate visual impairments, hearing disabilities, or those needing
                consistent navigation (e.g., older adults or users with cognitive challenges)</li>
                <li><strong>Why it’s popular:</strong> Level AA offers significant accessibility improvements without requiring complex changes that may be impractical for some websites.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Using a contrast checker to ensure your website’s text (e.g., black text on a white background) meets the 4.5:1 ratio requirement (1.4.3 Contrast Minimum).</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Level AA is often the legal benchmark for accessibility compliance, such as for
              government websites or businesses under ADA Title III. It’s a practical goal for most organizations.</p>

            <p>Level AAA is the highest level of accessibility, aiming for maximum inclusivity. It includes all Level A
            and AA criteria, plus additional, stricter requirements. However, achieving full Level AAA conformance is
            challenging and often impractical for most websites due to its demanding standards.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>What it covers:</strong> Level AAA focuses on enhancing accessibility for the widest possible audience. Examples include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Providing sign language interpretation for videos.</li>
                  <li>Ensuring even higher color contrast (e.g., 7:1 for text).</li>
                  <li>Offering extended context for complex content (e.g., simplified summaries).</li>
                </ul>
              <li><strong>Who it helps:</strong> Users with severe or multiple disabilities, such as those requiring highly customized interfaces or extensive accommodations.</li>
              <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Some Level AAA criteria, like sign language for all videos, are resource-intensive or not universally applicable. WCAG itself notes that Level AAA isn’t expected for entire websites.</li>
              <li><strong>Example:</strong> Adding a plain-language summary to a technical article (e.g., “This article explains how solar panels work in simple terms”) to meet criterion 3.1.5 (Reading Level).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> While full Level AAA conformance is rare, targeting specific AAA criteria can enhance user experience and demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity.</p>

    <h2>How to Get Started with Conformance</h2>
    <p>Achieving WCAG conformance involves testing your website against the success criteria for your target level.
    Here are practical steps to begin:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Run an Accessibility Audit:</strong> Use free tools like WAVE or axe to identify issues (e.g., missing alt text, low contrast).</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritize Fixes:</strong> Focus on Level A issues first (e.g., add keyboard support), then tackle Level AA (e.g., improve contrast).</li>
      <li><strong>Test with Users:</strong> Involve people with disabilities to ensure real-world usability.</li>
      <li><strong>Document Conformance:</strong> Create an Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) using the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) to show compliance efforts.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong><span class="text-danger">Pro Tip:</span> Start small—fix one issue, like adding alt text to images, and test it with a screen
    reader like NVDA or VoiceOver. You’ll be amazed at the impact!</strong></p>
