    <h2>{{page.subtitle}}</h2>
    <p>In today’s digital age, accessibility has become a crucial element of user experience design. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
    have been developed to ensure that websites and applications are usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities. Over the years,
    WCAG has evolved, with updates in WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2 that address emerging accessibility challenges.</p>

    <p>In this blog, we’ll cover WCAG 2.1, break down the differences between WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2, and highlight why these updates matter for
    developers, businesses, and users alike.</p>

    <h2>What’s New in WCAG 2.1?</h2>
    <p>Released in June 2018, WCAG 2.1 was an essential update that introduced 17 new success criteria to address the growing diversity of devices and user needs, especially in mobile accessibility and cognitive support.</p>

    <h3>Key Features of WCAG 2.1:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mobile Accessibility:</strong> The guidelines ensure that digital content is usable on mobile devices, regardless of screen size
      or input methods. This update recognizes the fact that more people than ever rely on mobile for their web browsing.</li>
      <li><strong>Support for Low Vision and Cognitive Disabilities:</strong> WCAG 2.1 introduced criteria to assist users with cognitive and
      learning disabilities, as well as those with low vision. These updates make content more perceivable and easier to understand.</li>
      <li><strong>Notable Success Criteria:</strong> Features like "Orientation," which allows users to switch between portrait and landscape modes,
      and "Text Spacing," enabling adjustments to text for better readability, were crucial additions to WCAG 2.1.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How WCAG 2.2 Builds on Accessibility Foundations</h2>
    <p>The release of WCAG 2.2 in December 2020 brought further refinement, adding nine new success criteria with a focus on usability and cognitive accessibility. This update makes user interface components more intuitive and ensures that websites are easier to navigate for all users, especially those with cognitive disabilities.</p>

    <h3>Key Success Criteria in WCAG 2.2:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Focus Appearance:</strong> WCAG 2.2 introduces visible focus states to help keyboard users see which interactive element is selected, making navigation more intuitive.</li>
      <li><strong>Target Size for Interactive Elements:</strong> Interactive elements like buttons and links now have size requirements, making them easier to click and improving accessibility for users with motor impairments.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistent Help and Redundant Entry:</strong> WCAG 2.2 provides consistent help mechanisms, minimizing the need for users to re-enter information repeatedly.</li>
      <li><strong>Simplified Accessibility Authentication:</strong> The update simplifies authentication processes, reducing reliance on memory-intensive tasks for logging in, such as remembering complex passwords or completing captchas.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These improvements build on WCAG 2.1, reinforcing the POUR principles of Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust design and making websites even more accessible for users with a range of disabilities.</p>

    <h2>Why Do These Updates Matter?</h2>
    <p>Both WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 reflect the evolving nature of digital content and user expectations. As our reliance on digital technologies grows,
    so too must our commitment to inclusivity. By adhering to these guidelines, developers ensure their websites are legally compliant and, more
    importantly, usable by everyone, regardless of ability.</p>

    <h2>What’s Next for Web Accessibility?</h2>
    <p>The future of accessibility is bright. As technology evolves, so will accessibility standards. In future updates to the WCAG guidelines,
    we can expect even more refined standards for a truly inclusive digital world.</p>

    <p>For businesses and developers, keeping up with these guidelines is not just about compliance—it’s about contributing to a more equitable web.
