    <h2>{{page.subtitle}}</h2>
    <p>In today’s digital-first world, accessibility is more than a feature—it’s a core principle of web design that ensures everyone can connect,
    learn, work, and access online services. Whether for social media, online shopping, or essential information, the internet is woven into modern
    life, making digital accessibility crucial. It’s about more than just meeting legal requirements; it’s about creating a web that’s inclusive and
    welcoming for all.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</strong> provide a roadmap to ensure that digital experiences are accessible for everyone, regardless
    of ability. In this series, we’ll explore WCAG’s progression and how each update expanded inclusivity, advanced technology, and promoted digital
    equity.</p>

    <h2>The Early Beginnings: WCAG 1.0 and Basic Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>When WCAG 1.0 launched in 1999, it marked a significant step in making the internet accessible. The primary focus was on essential
    accessibility, with an emphasis on creating web content usable by people with visual impairments.</p>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To make online content accessible for people with visual impairments.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Elements:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Text Alternatives:</strong> Ensuring visual content has text equivalents for screen readers.</li>
          <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Enhancing navigability for assistive devices like screen readers and keyboards.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure and Layout:</strong> Using HTML to structure content logically for easier comprehension by screen readers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>While WCAG 1.0 was groundbreaking, it primarily addressed visual disabilities. As the internet evolved, WCAG needed to adapt to new technologies and a more diverse user base.</p>

    <h2>WCAG 2.0 and the POUR Principles</h2>
    <p>In 2008, WCAG 2.0 introduced the <strong>POUR principles</strong> (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust) to address a broader
    range of disabilities and technologies. These principles provided a flexible framework for developers to make digital content accessible across
    various devices and abilities.</p>

    <h3 class="fs-4">The POUR Principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Perceivable:</strong> Content must be presented in ways users can perceive.</li>
      <li><strong>Operable:</strong> Users should be able to navigate and interact with content across input methods.</li>
      <li><strong>Understandable:</strong> Content should be clear and easy to interpret, with predictable navigation and error messages.</li>
      <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Content should be compatible with evolving technologies, ensuring it works seamlessly with assistive devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="fs-4">Why WCAG 2.0 Mattered</h3>
    <p>WCAG 2.0 set a standardized language for accessibility, guiding designers and developers in creating user-friendly websites. Its
    adaptability across devices, particularly mobile, marked accessibility as essential for all websites—not just a specialized feature.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Expanding Mobile Accessibility: WCAG 2.1</h2>
    <p>Released in 2018, WCAG 2.1 recognized the importance of mobile-friendly design and addressed cognitive and learning disabilities.
    This update introduced guidelines for touch-based interactions, small screens, and usability improvements for those with cognitive challenges.</p>

    <h3>Key Highlights:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mobile Usability:</strong> Guidance for accessible mobile interactions, such as larger touch targets, adjustable text spacing, and minimal reliance on fine motor skills.</li>
      <li><strong>Cognitive Disabilities: </strong> Recommendations to avoid distracting animations and auto-updating content to create a calmer, more user-friendly experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By embracing mobile accessibility, WCAG 2.1 extended digital inclusion to users navigating unique challenges due to environment, age, or disability.</p>

    <h2>Enhanced Focus on Cognitive Accessibility: WCAG 2.2</h2>
    <p>Launched in 2021, WCAG 2.2 introduced nine new success criteria focused on cognitive accessibility, ease of navigation, and improved authentication processes. These updates continue to simplify digital interactions and reduce the cognitive demands of web navigation.</p>

    <h3 class="fs-4">Key Enhancements in WCAG 2.2:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cognitive Support:</strong> Features like memory-free authentication reduce the need for password recall, benefiting users with memory or focus challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved Navigation:</strong> Guidelines for intuitive navigation, clear form elements, and interactive features enhance the overall user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These updates reflect a commitment to designing websites that are not only accessible but also easier to use for everyone.</p>

    <h2>The Real-World Impact of Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Accessible design doesn’t just help people with disabilities—it improves the user experience for all. For example, captions benefit those
    in noisy environments, while intuitive navigation and layouts make sites easier to use for everyone.</p>

    <h3 class="fs-4">Key Benefits of Accessibility:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Enhanced Usability:</strong> Accessible design often streamlines and simplifies site layout.</li>
      <li><strong>Broader Audience Reach:</strong> An accessible site serves a wider audience, including older adults and those with situational disabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Many countries require website accessibility; WCAG offers a clear framework for meeting these standards.</li>
    </ul>
