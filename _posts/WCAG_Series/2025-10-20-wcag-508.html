<h2>{{page.subtitle}}</h2>
<p>Welcome to the fourth post in our WCAG for Beginners series at Kaffeinated Kodemonkey! We’ve covered the basics of
WCAG and Section 508, their historical evolution, and the updates in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2. Now, let’s explore who these
standards are for and how you fit into the accessibility puzzle. Whether you’re a developer, designer, or federal
contractor, understanding your role is the first step to building inclusive digital experiences.</p>

<p>Think of accessibility as a team effort to build a ramp for a building—everyone from architects to builders has a
part to play. WCAG and Section 508 target specific audiences to ensure web content and ICT (Information and Communications
Technology) are usable by people with disabilities. Let’s break down who these standards serve and how you can get
involved.</p>

    <h2>WCAG: A Global Standard for Many Roles</h2>
    <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI),
    are designed for a broad audience. As of its latest iteration, WCAG 2.2 (finalized as ISO/IEC 40500 in October 2025),
    it’s a universal blueprint for making web content—like text, images, and code—accessible. Here’s who WCAG is for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> You’re the builders coding websites, apps, or digital tools. WCAG provides guidelines (e.g., ensuring alt text for images or keyboard navigation) to make your work inclusive. For example, adding a proper lang attribute helps screen readers:
      <strong>{% highlight html %}<html lang="en">{% endhighlight %}</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Content Creators:</strong> Writers, videographers, and editors creating text, media, or forms must ensure content is perceivable and understandable (e.g., captions for videos).</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluators and Testers:</strong> Accessibility auditors use WCAG’s success criteria to test compliance with tools like WAVE or axe DevTools. </li>
      <li><strong>Tool Creators:</strong> Those building CMS platforms or authoring tools (e.g., WordPress) use WCAG alongside ATAG (Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines) to ensure their tools support accessible outputs.</li>
      <li><strong>Organizations and Policymakers:</strong> Businesses and governments adopt WCAG to meet legal or ethical goals, ensuring websites serve diverse users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>WCAG’s flexibility makes it relevant globally, with translations available for non-English audiences. Check the WAI Resources for beginner-friendly guides, even for non-technical staff.</p>

    <h2>Section 508: A U.S. Federal Focus</h2>
    <p>Section 508, part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, is more specific. Its 2017 refresh mandates WCAG 2.0 A/AA compliance for federal agencies and contractors in the U.S., covering web and non-web ICT (e.g., PDFs, software). Here’s who it targets:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Federal Agencies:</strong> Government entities must ensure their websites, intranets, and digital documents meet WCAG 2.0 A/AA standards. </li>
      <li><strong>Federal Contractors:</strong> If you supply ICT to the government, you’re required to provide a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) documenting compliance. For example, a PDF report needs tags for screen reader compatibility:
      <strong>{% highlight html %}<TaggedPDF-doc><strong>{% endhighlight %}</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility Teams:</strong> Those using tools like ANDI or DHS Trusted Tester protocols to verify Section 508 compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unlike WCAG’s global scope, Section 508 is U.S.-specific but critical for federal contracts. “Section 508 ensures the government leads by example in accessibility,” says the U.S. Access Board, which enforces these standards.</p>

    <h2>WAI Resources: Bridging the Gap</h2>
    <p>The WAI offers resources like tutorials, “How to Meet WCAG,” and non-technical guides (e.g., Accessibility Fundamentals). These are perfect for managers or marketers who need to understand accessibility without diving into code. Compare your tools to WAI’s ATAG and UAAG (User Agent Accessibility Guidelines) to ensure they support WCAG and Section 508 goals.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Your Role in Accessibility</h2>
    <p>No matter your role, you’re part of the accessibility ecosystem. A developer might test keyboard navigation, while a contractor ensures VPATs are ready. As accessibility expert Léonie Watson says, “Inclusion is everyone’s responsibility.” Start by identifying where you fit and exploring WAI’s resources tailored to your needs.</p>

    <h2>Practical Checklist: Get Involved Today</h2>
    <p>Here’s a beginner-friendly checklist to kickstart your accessibility journey:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>- Identify your role (e.g., developer, tester, content creator).</li>
      <li>- Review WAI resources for non-technical staff at W3C WAI. </li>
      <li>- Check if your tools (e.g., CMS, testing software) align with Section 508 requirements. </li>
    </ul>
