    <p>In today’s digital age, designing an inclusive online experience is not only a best practice but a responsibility. Many small and medium-sized
    enterprises (SMEs) are focusing on the latest <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</strong> standards, yet understanding
    earlier guidelines, such as WCAG 2.0, is essential to fully grasp the evolution and importance of accessibility. In our previous post, we
    explored the history of <strong>web accessibility;</strong> today, we’ll dive into <strong>WCAG 2.0,</strong> the foundational guidelines
    that shaped current standards.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re a <strong>business owner, developer,</strong> or <strong>content creator,</strong> understanding <strong>WCAG 2.0 principles</strong>
    is crucial for creating compliant, accessible websites. This post provides an overview of each <strong>WCAG 2.0 principle</strong> and offers
    tips to help you start building an inclusive web experience.</p>

    <h2>WCAG 2.0: The Foundational Principles for Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 2008, <strong>WCAG 2.0</strong> set the global standard for making web content
    accessible to a diverse range of users, including individuals with <strong>visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and neurological
    disabilities</strong>. WCAG 2.0 is organized around four guiding principles, commonly referred to as <strong>POUR:</strong></p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-7">
    <dl>
      <dt><h3>Perceivable</h3></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Content must be presented in ways that users can perceive, especially those with sensory disabilities such as vision or hearing
        impairments. <strong>Perceivable</strong> content means users can see, hear, or otherwise access the information.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Success Criteria:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Text Alternatives:</strong> Provide text for all non-text content, such as alt text for images, captions for videos, and transcripts for audio files.</li>
          <li><strong>Adaptable Content:</strong> Ensure content can be displayed in various ways without losing meaning (e.g., adjustable text size and high-contrast options).</li>
          <li><strong>Distinguishable Content:</strong> Use sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds, and provide clear audio controls to assist users with visual or auditory needs.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><h3>Operable</h3></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Users should be able to navigate and operate the interface using various tools, including <strong>assistive technologies</strong>.
        Ensuring content is <strong>operable</strong> helps users interact effectively, regardless of their preferred navigation method.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Success Criteria:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time to Interact:</strong> Ensure all functionality is accessible via keyboard navigation.</li>
          <li><strong>Adequate Interaction Time:</strong> Allow users enough time to read and interact with content.</li>
          <li><strong>Seizure Prevention:</strong> Avoid flashing images or animations that could trigger seizures.</li>
          <li><strong>Navigation Aids:</strong> Provide intuitive navigation elements, such as breadcrumbs or consistent menus, to help users find what they need quickly.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><h3>Understandable</h3></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Content should be easy to comprehend and predict in terms of function and layout. This principle ensures understandable and predictable
        interactions for users of all abilities.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Success Criteria:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simple Language:</strong> Use plain language that’s easy to understand.</li>
          <li><strong>Predictable Layouts:</strong> Keep navigation elements consistent across pages.</li>
          <li><strong>Error Assistance:</strong> Provide helpful error messages and validation cues.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><h3>Robust</h3></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Content should work well across various devices and assistive technologies, both now and in the future. Ensuring your content is
        robust means it can adapt to evolving tools and accessibility features.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Success Criteria:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Compatible Code:</strong> Ensure that HTML and other coding languages adhere to standards, facilitating interaction with screen readers and other adaptive devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Assistive Technology Testing:</strong> Test your website with different assistive devices and software to ensure full accessibility.</li>

    <h2>Why WCAG 2.0 Compliance Matters</h2>
    <p>Following <strong>WCAG 2.0 standards</strong> isn’t only about meeting legal requirements; it’s about creating a positive, inclusive user
    experience. In many regions, non-compliance with accessibility laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the European
    Accessibility Act, can lead to legal repercussions.</p>

    <p>Accessible websites are also generally more <strong>user-friendly</strong>, which can improve <strong>SEO</strong> and enhance your brand’s
    reputation. Meeting <strong>WCAG 2.0 requirements</strong> not only helps avoid legal risks but opens your website to a broader audience,
    including users who may otherwise struggle with access.</p>
