<h2>{{page.subtitle}}</h2>
<p>Welcome to the sixth installment of the WCAG Series at Kaffeinated Kodemonkey! By now, you’ve learned the basics of WCAG and Section 508, explored the evolution of web accessibility, compared the two standards, dived into POUR design principles, and understood their focus on inclusive digital experiences. Today, we’re zooming in on how WCAG is developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG) under the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), how Section 508 is enforced by the U.S. Access Board, and—most excitingly—how you can contribute to accessibility as a developer. Let’s jump in!</p>

<h2>WCAG Development: Who’s Building the Future of Accessibility?</h2>
<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are crafted by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG), part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) under the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This group of accessibility experts, developers, and advocates collaborates to ensure WCAG evolves with technology and user needs. They’re currently working on WCAG 3.0, which aims to be more flexible for emerging tech like AI and AR/VR.</p>
<p>The AG WG relies on community input to refine guidelines. This means developers like you can help shape the future of accessibility by sharing feedback or joining discussions.</p>

<h2>Section 508 Enforcement: Accessibility in Action</h2>
<p>Section 508, part of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act, ensures that federal agencies and their contractors make digital tools accessible. The U.S. Access Board enforces these rules, requiring compliance with WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards. Enforcement means audits, compliance checks, and consequences like lawsuits for non-compliant federal projects. For developers, this underscores the importance of building accessible solutions when working on government contracts.</p>

<h2>Why Developers Should Get Involved</h2>
<p>Contributing to WCAG or Section 508 efforts isn’t just about compliance—it’s about making the web work for everyone. Here’s why it matters:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Your work can help millions with disabilities access digital content.</li>
  <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Tackling accessibility sharpens your coding and problem-solving abilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Career Boost:</strong> Expertise in WCAG and Section 508 is a standout skill in government or enterprise projects.</li>
</ul>
