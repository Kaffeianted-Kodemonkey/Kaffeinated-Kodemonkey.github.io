<h2>Question?</h2>
<p>At Kaffeinated Kodemonkey we build and certify websites to be <a href="{{site.url}}/Web-Accessibility/ADA-Compliance">ADA compliant</a>.

<p>We would like to know how many people with disabilities have been affected by <a href="{{site.url}}/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> from a working perspective. Has your company turned to a remote/work-from-home platform? Are you an employee that can not work form home do to a disability and the way your employers website or software is built?</p>

<h2>Let's Talk</h2>
<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey is not here to point fingers or diminish any business, company or employer. We are specialists in online Accessibility and understand that business may not be ready for this shift in their platform.</p>

<p>We want to understand how this shift has affected you as and employee, boss, business owner etc..</p>

<p>Together we can be stronger and work to ReOpening Colorado as well and prepare us for the new normal.</p>

are working through it. We would also like to know how our services could help a business/company that employees people with a disability.</p>
