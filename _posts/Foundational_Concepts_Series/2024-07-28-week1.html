<h2>Making the Web A11y for Everyone</h2>
<p>Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of their abilities, can navigate the web effortlessly. That’s the goal behind the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These guidelines ensure web content is accessible to
all users, including those with disabilities.</p>

<h2>The Foundation of A11y</h2>
<p>In 2008, WCAG 2.0 introduced the POUR principles, a framework for developers and accessibility experts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Perceivable:</strong> Present information in ways that users can perceive, such as text alternatives for non-text content and captions for multimedia.</li>
  <li><strong>Operable:</strong> Ensure user interface components and navigation are operable, like making all functionality available from a keyboard and allowing enough time to read and use content.</li>
  <li><strong>Understandable:</strong> Make information and the operation of the user interface understandable. This means readable text, predictable web pages, and the ability to avoid and correct mistakes.</li>
  <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Ensure content is robust enough to be interpreted reliably by various user agents, including assistive technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following these principles helps make websites more user-friendly and inclusive.</p>

<h2>Evolution of WCAG</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>WCAG 2.0 (2008)</strong> Introduced the foundational POUR principles.</li>
  <li><strong>WCAG 2.1 (2018)</strong> Extended guidelines to improve accessibility for mobile users and individuals with disabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>WCAG 2.2 (2021)</strong> The latest version focuses on enhancing accessibility, especially for those with cognitive and learning disabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Future Version: WCAG 3.0</strong> Expected to provide more flexible guidelines, focus on user needs, and offer improved testing methods.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Updates in WCAG 2.2</h2>
<p>WCAG 2.2 provides additional success criteria since WCAG 2.1. The 2.0 and 2.1 success criteria are essentially the same in
2.2, with one exception: 4.1.1 Parsing is obsolete and removed from WCAG 2.2. More information can be found in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/#parsing411" target="_blank">WCAG 2 FAQ, 4.1.1 Parsing</a>. WCAG 2.2 includes
notes about different languages; more information is in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/#i18n22" target="_blank">WCAG 2 FAQ, internationalization</a>.</p>

<p>WCAG 2.2 introduces new success criteria to further enhance accessibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Focus Appearance:</strong> Ensures focus indicators are clearly visible, aiding navigation of interactive elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Dragging Movements - Target size:</strong> Adjusted criteria ensure interactive targets, such as buttons and links, are of adequate size, making them easier to interact with.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistent help - Redudent entry:</strong> Provides consistent help mechanisms throughout a site, reducing the need for users to re-enter information.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility Authentication:</strong> Criteria ensure that authentication processes do not rely solely on memory or complex tasks, simplifying logins for all users.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the new criteria for accessible authentication help ensure users can log in without relying solely on memory or performing complex tasks. These updates reflect a growing understanding of diverse user needs and aim to make web content more usable for everyone.</p>

<h2>Integrating WCAG 2.2</h2>
<p>Integrating WCAG 2.2 into your web design and development processes can seem daunting, but the benefits are well worth
the effort. Start by conducting an accessibility audit of your existing content to identify areas for improvement.
Understanding where your site currently stands with ADA compliance will make the task less overwhelming.</p>
