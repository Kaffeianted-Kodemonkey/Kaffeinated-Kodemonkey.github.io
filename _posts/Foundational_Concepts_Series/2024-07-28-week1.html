    <h2>{{page.subtitle}}</h2>
    <p>Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of their abilities, can navigate the web effortlessly. This vision drives the Web
    Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These guidelines are more than just rules—they’re
    the foundation for creating web content that’s accessible to all, including people with disabilities.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">The Foundation of Web Accessibility: <strong><em>POUR</em></strong> Design</h3>
    <p>In 2008, WCAG 2.0 introduced the POUR principles, a framework that every developer and accessibility expert should know by
    heart:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Perceivable:</strong> Information should be presented in ways that everyone can perceive.
      Think text alternatives for non-text content, or captions for videos—everyone deserves to access content, regardless of their
      sensory abilities.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Operable:</strong> Make sure that all users can operate your site. This means every
      functionality should be available from a keyboard, with enough time to read and interact with the content.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Understandable:</strong> Your website’s information and operation should be easy to
      understand. This includes readable text, predictable page layouts, and user-friendly error handling.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Robust:</strong> Content needs to be robust enough to work reliably with various
      technologies, including assistive tools. No user should be left out because their tech isn't compatible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Mastering these principles isn’t just about compliance; it’s about making your site more user-friendly and inclusive.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">The Evolution of WCAG: Keeping Up with Progress</h3>
    <p>Web accessibility isn’t static. As technology and our understanding of user needs evolve, so do the WCAG standards:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">WCAG 2.0 (2008)</strong> Laid the groundwork with the <strong><em>POUR</em></strong> principles listed above.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">WCAG 2.1 (2018)</strong> Expanded the guidelines, focusing on mobile users and people with disabilities.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">WCAG 2.2 (2021)</strong> The latest version, which places a spotlight on enhancing accessibility for cognitive and
      learning disabilities.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><strong class="fs-5">Looking Ahead - WCAG 3.0</strong> Expected to bring even more flexible guidelines,
      focus on diverse user needs, and offer improved testing methods.</li>
    </ul>
