<p>Our <strong>Accessibility Monitoring Platform</strong>, developed by PopeTech and powered by the trusted WAVE engine, is designed for in-house development teams and digital
agencies that manage multiple websites. This platform ensures ongoing compliance with <strong>WCAG</strong>, <strong>Section 508</strong>, and local accessibility standards,
allowing your team to focus on building accessible content from the start. Supported by <strong>DHS Certified Trusted Testers</strong>, this monitoring service provides
comprehensive coverage and actionable insights to help you maintain an accessible web presence.</p>

<p>The platform comes with support by A11y Developers that are DHS Certified Trusted Testers to assist as needed and a <strong>Proof of Compliance
(POC) Certificate</strong> providing transparent documentation that verifies your website’s commitment to accessibility. This certificate serves as a
powerful asset, communicating to visitors, stakeholders, and clients that your site meets legal accessibility requirements and adheres to ADA standards.</p>
