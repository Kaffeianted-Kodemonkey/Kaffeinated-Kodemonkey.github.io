    <p>The POC Certificate serves as a compilation of documents that validate your website's adherence to ADA regulations.
    It encompasses websites, kiosks, applications, PDFs, and all online content classified as ICT (Information and Communications
    Technology) falling under Title III. This title strictly prohibits discrimination based on disability in "places of public
    accommodation." As businesses increasingly shift towards digital platforms, ADA regulations are continually evolving to ensure parity
    in experiences both online and offline.</p>

    <p>Acquiring a POC Certificate serves as an explicit demonstration to your site visitors that you prioritize accessibility and strive
    to offer an exceptional experience to all users. Moreover, it provides documented evidence of your product's compliance level, outlines
    how your company handles non-compliance issues, and offers guidance on whom to contact in case users encounter challenges while
    accessing or navigating your product.</p>
