      as you'er reading this. One thing that I need for you tod is to make sure my email address, kodemonkey@kaffeinatedkodemonkey.com,
      is white-listed, added to your address book, or however you make sure that important emails don'wind up in your spam folder. If
      for some reason you don't gt the email with the link in the next 30 minutes, let me know and I'll send it to you again.</p>
